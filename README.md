📊 Power BI – Data Professional Survey Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing survey data from 630+ data professionals.  

The objective was to clean, transform, and model raw survey data to extract meaningful insights about salary trends, job roles, geographic distribution, and satisfaction levels.



🛠 Tools \& Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query (Data Cleaning \& Transformation)  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Data Modeling \& Relationships  
- KPI Cards, Gauges, Bar Charts, Donut Charts  
- Interactive Filters \& Dashboard Design  

🧹 Data Preparation (Power Query)
Before building the dashboard, the dataset was transformed using Power Query:
- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing/null values  
- Standardized categorical fields (roles, countries, etc.)
